    <h1>-777-</h1>
    <p>I’ve been talking my shit since I was a little boy, unfiltered. I’ve always spoken for the ones who don’t. The ones in the back of the classroom. The ones who didn’t fit in with the others, who got looked down on, overlooked, or written off. I’ve said what most were afraid to. Stood up when no one else did. For myself, and for others. I was the type to get in trouble. I was suspended, kicked out of school. I started smoking and partying around 12 or 13, just being an absolute menace. And still, somehow, I found my way out. I’ve been ignorant too. I’ve crashed five cars, most of them brand new. One of them nearly killed me. That’s 100K just in cars. It took a while before I could even trust myself behind the wheel again. I’ve always liked Jeeps for some reason and I’ll probably get one of those next.

My perceived immaturity was really just me not caring what people thought and living how I wanted to live because I knew I was headed somewhere serious. I was the kid with the weird haircuts, the one who made my own swag with whatever I had. Life’s too short to stay boxed in by the mental bubbles most people live in. They never leave their comfort zone. I wasn’t always financially smart. I was reckless with money, caught in the fast life. But what do you expect when you give a poor kid a whole lot of racks? I didn’t know how to act. I’ve always been a fan of fashion. I do it for all the times I didn’t have shit. Some people argue that I’m wasting all my money on clothes, but if I’m only spending less than 5%, then do the math. I’m not saying people don’t do it but I always knew better than that. 

It’s ironic how you can be the worst and best influence at the same time. I know some people’s families judged me without knowing me, but that’s what happens when you lack context and only see the surface. I grew up in an area where privileged kids were fed with silver spoons and got whatever they wanted, while I had to watch my family worried about rent, worried about whether we’d have to move out and start over somewhere else or even go back to our country. I don’t do what I do as a flex, but more as a reminder not to underestimate me, that the universe works in mysterious ways and you can do whatever you put your mind to. No amount of money will ever change me. Even if I make ten times more, I’m still rolling up my sleeves and working hard. Maybe when I’m 30 or older I’ll think about slowing down. But not yet.

I don’t have enemies. Whoever thinks they are is just fighting their own reflection. I’ve always been chill with everyone, it’s about respect. If you lack that, we don’t need to speak. I know there are people waiting for me to fall. Maybe they’re offended by how real I am, or intimidated by what I’m capable of. Either way, I’ve always been ten steps ahead. I’m not surprised, I understand the game. But don’t ever confuse silence with weakness. People that talked all that shit or made fun, I’ve seen them in person and what’s become of their life and it shows that karma is real. I see them and they’re not about it. That’s what happens when you do all that talking. I know they’re probably furious to read this, but that’s just how things go. Be nice to everyone. They should’ve done something with their life instead of wasting time talking. I understand we’re all human. I just knew what I had to do and did it. People start comparing themselves to others and get bitter. Truth is: your life is what you make of it. I root for everyone I came up with, the ones I shared lunch tables and memories with. I love all of you, even the ones I haven’t seen in years. And if you hear me talking my shit and it stings, it’s not about you, it’s about the ones who doubted me and pretended I wouldn’t be anything.

I value my privacy. Even now, I’ve made it further without chasing clout or posting my face a hundred times a day. I don’t even have TikTok. While others were chasing crumbs, I studied the loaf. I didn’t sign the wrong deals. I didn’t sell my face for attention. I learned the business. That alone put me in a different category. While others were chasing numbers during the pandemic, I went ghost. Under the radar. Off the grid. Chess, not checkers. And I noticed people started copying. A lot of people are lying on the internet, showing off sports cars or flexing a lifestyle they’re not really living. It’s all smoke and mirrors, and I see right through it. People saying they ‘made it happen’ but didn’t make shit happen, still relying on content and staged luxury. Others are splitting bills five ways just to post like it was all them.

Music should be fun. People act too serious about it, like they’re scared to enjoy new waves. I was listening to Young Thug when people called it weird. That should tell you everything. I couldn’t be like everyone else, I had to be known for being me. I’m honored to contribute behind the scenes in hip-hop, making new sounds, creating subgenres, and shaping what’s next. And the best part? People who don’t like me will end up bumping songs I’ve been a part of. If they knew, they’d probably delete it. That’s how you know it’s real. I'm gonna be releasing music for fun, not to blow up. I don’t need to. I’ve done everything I wanted to and I don’t want to lose myself or the love I have for music. I had to be the one to put Ecuador on the map, no one else was doing it. We’ve been overlooked for too long.

I’ve been spending time with my family. They gave me everything they could, now I’m giving everything I’ve got. My dad’s had me working with him since I was a kid. I know what real work looks like. I’ve done it. I built my studio by myself, from the flooring to the table, to the painting. I recently bought a house in the Hamptons and I’m planning on doing a bunch of remodeling and additions. A lot of it will be worked on by myself, with the help of my dad. I’m also working on getting another one just for him. My family will never tell people what’s really going on because we’re not the type to talk about our achievements like that. We keep it looking like we live regular lives. It’s better that way. People stay too focused on other people’s plates and end up letting their own food go cold.

There’s more coming. Seven Hollow Co is one of the businesses I've been building, focused on designing and building custom homes in the Hamptons. It will also create job opportunities for people who come here to work and build a better life, just like my parents did. I’ve made it into rooms that only a few ever reach, and I’ve done it without selling myself out. That’s what makes someone a gatekeeper. That’s how you move like the elite.
